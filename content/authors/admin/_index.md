I am a 5th year Developmental Psychology Ph.D. candidate from Tampa, Florida. I am interested in the reciprocal relationship between attention and learning, and how daily experiences influence cognitive development. My recent studies examine how infants and children allocate attention to different types of faces and objects ranging in familiarity and reward value.
